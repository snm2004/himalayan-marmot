        heading: "Understanding Altitude Sickness",
        paragraphs: [
          "Altitude sickness, medically known as Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS), is the body's response to reduced oxygen levels at high elevations. In Ladakh, where most riding happens between 10,000 and 18,000 feet, altitude sickness is not just a possibility—it's a near certainty if proper precautions aren't taken.",
          "The condition occurs when you ascend too quickly for your body to adapt to the lower oxygen levels. At 12,000 feet, the air contains about 40% less oxygen than at sea level. At 18,000 feet, it's nearly 50% less. Your body needs time to adjust to these dramatic changes through a process called acclimatization."
